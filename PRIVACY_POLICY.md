## Data Collection

We do **not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information.

The extension operates entirely within your browser. All data scraped from Google Maps business profiles is processed locally.

## Permissions Used

### `activeTab`
This permission allows the extension to read the current Google Maps page content in order to extract public business profile data.

### `scripting` (only when executed by the user)
Allows safe code injection into the active tab to extract and display information through a popup window.

We do **not** access tabs outside of Google Maps. No background tracking or analytics are used.
